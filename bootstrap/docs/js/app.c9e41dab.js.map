<p>\n                                『万葉集』や『古事記』、また『竹取物語』や『伊勢物語』など多くの古典は、いずれも作者、あるいは編者の手になる原本はおろか、その成立した時代の写本すら今日に伝わらない。『源氏物語』についても事情は同じである。\n                            </p>\n                            <p>\n                                ということは、今日の読者が読んでいる日本古典のほとんどは、いずれも原本から何度にもわたる転写を経た後世の写本、それをもとにしたテキストであっ て、厳密に考えれば、後世の読者は原本とはある程度異なった本文を読んでいるということになる。その「異なり」の「程度」は個々の作品によってまちまちで はあろうけれども。\n

は、『源氏物語』の成立から五百年近く後の室町時代、文明１３年（１４８１）９月の飛鳥井（藤原）雅康（１４３６〜１５０９）書写奥書を有する大島本である。</p>\n    \n                            <p>池田亀鑑によれば、大島本は、藤原定家の校訂になる青表紙本『源氏物語』の復元に資するところの多い、稀にみる善本ということであり、今日なおその評価は変わらない。</p>\n    \n                            <p>しかし、その善本、大島本の持つ可能性は、あくまで定家本（青表紙本）の復元という点に関してであって、たとえその復元が完璧に近く実現されたとしても、成立時の『源氏物語』との間には、まだ２００年の空白が残される。</p>\n    \n                            <p>『源氏物語』原本への遡源は容易なことではない。</p>\n
